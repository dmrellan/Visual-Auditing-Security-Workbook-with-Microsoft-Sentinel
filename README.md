# Overview

The _Visual Auditing Security Workbook_ project comprises a collection of scenarios within an Azure Workbook tailored for Microsoft Sentinel. This workbook extracts pertinent information from your Active Directory Domain Controllers, empowering security teams to promptly discern insights regarding their Active Directory configuration, operations, and potential risks.

The workbook seamlessly visualizes data from two primary sources:
- **Security Events** from Domain Controllers and common **Events**.
- Active Directory users and computers account data submited by the **Custom HTTP Data Collector API**.

The existing Visual Auditing Security Workbook encompasses the following 11 scenarios ([Appendix with screenshots](https://github.com/dmrellan/Visual-Auditing-Security-with-Microsoft-Sentinel#Appendix---Screenshoots) at the end of this article):

1. **User Hygiene**: 
    - This scenario provides a comprehensive overview of the user population's status. It evaluates key aspects such as high-privilege users, individuals who have not logged in over an extended period, users with unchanged passwords for an extended duration, and those with the "Password Never Expired" setting enabled.
2. **Computer Hygiene**: 
    - This scenario offers a snapshot of active computers within the domain, categorized by their operating system versions. It identifies machines with stale logins and passwords, providing essential insights into the overall hygiene of your computing environment.
3. **LAPS Deploy**: 
    - The Local Administrative Password Solution (LAPS) Deploy tab reveals the number of computers configured with the LAPS solution. It specifies which operating systems have LAPS deployed and provides an up-to-dateness vector for the LAPS Password, ensuring that security teams can easily monitor and manage local administrator passwords.
4. **LAPS Audit**: 
    - In this tab, users can track who retrieves passwords for local systems for local use. LAPS Auditing exposes the user accounts that access local administrator passwords on specific computers, aiding in the identification of potential security risks.
5. **Non-Existent users activity**: 
    - This scenario monitors activities related to non-existent and potentially "sprayed" accounts in your environment. By identifying failed logins linked to non-existent accounts, security teams can recognize patterns indicative of an early attack or attempted intrusion.
6. **Group Changes**: 
    - The Group Changes tab highlights modifications made to Active Directory Groups, showcasing both the altered groups and the users responsible for the changes. This visibility aids in tracking and understanding group-related activities within the domain.
7. **User Authentication**: 
    - This tab provides insights into user authentication activities, offering an overview of the authentication processes performed by specific users. It enhances the understanding of user interactions with the system and helps identify any unusual authentication patterns.
8. **SChannel**: 
    - The SChannel tab reveals instances of SChannel authentication, specifying the initiating computer. By temporarily installing the Azure Monitor Agent on suspected servers, teams can analyze cipher suites and address any deprecated encryption methods in use.
9. **Security Log Clear**: 
    - This scenario identifies instances where the security log has been cleared and provides information on the user responsible. Detecting such events is crucial for maintaining the integrity of security logs and investigating potential security breaches.
10. **Audit Policy Changes**: 
    - The Audit Policy Changes tab reveals attempts by attackers to cover their tracks by potentially creating environmental persistence. This information is vital for identifying and mitigating security threats aimed at altering audit policies.
11. **User Management**:
    - This scenario focuses on the most common user management activities within the forest. By providing visibility into changes in user management, it aids in identifying any alterations to user accounts, ensuring the security of user access remains intact.


 
> **Note**: In addition to leveraging the *Visual Auditing Security Workbook*, we strongly recommend utilizing the **[Insecure Protocols](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/azure-sentinel-insecure-protocols-workbook-reimagined/ba-p/1558375)** workbook within Microsoft Sentinel. This supplementary tool is instrumental in identifying the presence of insecure protocols and plays a crucial role in eliminating them from both your Active Directory and Azure Active Directory environments. By incorporating insights from the *Insecure Protocols* workbook, your security team can further enhance the overall resilience of your systems and fortify them against potential vulnerabilities associated with insecure communication protocols.

# Prerequisites

Before implementing the Visual Auditing Security Workbook and its associated scenarios, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites to guarantee a seamless setup and effective utilization:

1. **Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have an active Azure Subscription with a provisioned **Microsoft Sentinel workspace**.

2. **Group Policy Object (GPO)**: 
   - Create a new GPO to enable the necessary **audit policies** and **registry keys** in your Active Directory.
   - Apply this GPO to your Domain Controllers to enforce the required security configurations.

3. **Security Auditing Configuration for LAPS (Local Administrative Password Solution)**: 
   - Set up Security Auditing Configuration Lists (SACL) to enable auditing for LAPS activities.

4. **Custom HTTP Data Collector API Configuration**: 
   - Configure the **Custom HTTP Data Collector API (PowerShell script)** to collect and submit Active Directory users and computers account data.

5. **Azure Monitor Agent Deployment**: 
   - Connect your Domain Controllers to Microsoft Sentinel by deploying the **Azure Monitor Agent**.
   - This agent facilitates the collection of relevant data for analysis.

6. **Data Collection Rules**: 
   - Create two [**Data Collection Rules**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview?tabs=portal) to collect specific event data (_Events_ and _SecurityEvents_) based on XPath queries.
   - Associate these rules with your Domain Controllers to capture essential information for the scenarios.

    - Resource Group: _your resource group_
    - Region: _your region where the dcr is deployed_
    - Platform type: Windows
3. Click **Next** and go to the _Resources_ tab. Leave the resources blank (we're only creating the DCR in this step).
4. Click **Next** and go to the _Collect and deliver_ tab. Click on **+ Add data source**.
5. Create a new **Windows Event Log** data source by using the below custom xPath queries:
    > - System!*[System[(EventID=36880)]]
    > - Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Audit!*[System[EventID=3000]]
    > - Directory Service!*[System[(EventID=2889)]]
    > - System!*[System[(EventID=5827) or (EventID=5829) or (EventID=5828) or (EventID=5830) or (EventID=5831)]]
    > - Application!*[System[(EventID=1900) or (EventID=19191) or (EventID=1919) or (EventID=19201) or (EventID=1920) or (EventID=1921) or (EventID=19211) or (EventID=1922) or (EventID=1923)]]

![image](https://github.com/dmrellan/Visual-Auditing-Security-Workbook-with-Microsoft-Sentinel/assets/35997289/39c197b2-8517-4343-8f71-902c803cb00a)

6. Select your Sentinel workspace as **destination**.
7. Add the necessary **tags** based on your tag policy and finish the wizard.

### DCR to collect 'SecurityEvents'

1. Go to Azure Portal > Sentinel.
2. Install the **Windows Security Events via AMA** data connector from **Content Hub**
3. Go to Data connectors to configure the **Windows Security Events via AMA** data connector with the following Data Collection Rule:
    - Rule Name: dcr-VASW-Sentinel-SecurityEvents-001 (or other which fits with your naming convention)
    - Subscription: _your subscription_
    - Resource Group: _your resource group_
4. Create a new **DCR** by using the below custom xPath queries:
    > - Security!*[System[(EventID=1102) or (EventID=4624) or (EventID=4625) or (EventID=4719) or (EventID=4720) or (EventID=4722) or (EventID=4724) or (EventID=4725) or (EventID=4726) or (EventID=4728) or (EventID=4729) or (EventID=4732) or (EventID=4733) or (EventID=4740) or (EventID=4756)]]
    > - Security!*[System[(EventID=4757) or (EventID=4765) or (EventID=4766) or (EventID=4768) or (EventID=4769) or (EventID=4771) or (EventID=4776) or (EventID=4794)]]
    > - Security!*[System[EventID=4662]] and (*[EventData[Data[@Name='SubjectUserSid'] !='S-1-5-18']] and *[EventData[Data[@Name='ObjectType'] ='%{bf967a86-0de6-11d0-a285-00aa003049e2}']])

![image](https://github.com/dmrellan/Visual-Auditing-Security-Workbook-with-Microsoft-Sentinel/assets/35997289/e89277db-d008-463d-9c92-1798032fce8d)

5. Review and create the DCR.

## 4. Setup the Custom HTTP Data Collector API (PowerShell script) to populate Custom Logs.

The workbook requires Active Directory Objects (users, computers, groups, etc.) information to populate Hygiene and LAPS tabs. This information is collected by the custom data collector and uploaded to Microsoft Sentinel as Custom Logs.
Follow these steps to configure the Custom HTTP Data Collector:

1. Use one Domain Controller or another server to run the Custom HTTP Data Collector.
2. Open an elevated PowerShell console and install the **RSAT AD DS Powershell module** by running the command:
<pre><code>Install-windowsfeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell</code></pre>
3. Create the new **VASWDataToSentinel** event log source by executing the following command:
<pre><code>New-EventLog –LogName Application –Source "VASWDataToSentinel"</code></pre>
4. Fill and personalize the parameters section of the **ADObjectsToALA.ps1** PS script.
5. Fill the **domainlist.csv** according your environment. This file needs to have the headers line (dc,isLAPSDeployed) and one Domain Controller name and isLAPSDeployed value (comma separated) per line from each domain in scope as you can see in the following image.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35997289/147013878-80b68c94-1a30-4bb5-a8fb-dc1554e60104.png)

6. Create a scheduled task to run the PowerShell script **daily**.
7. To verify that the PowerShell script is running successfully and Custom Logs are created in the Microsoft Sentinel workspace:
  1. Execute the PowerShell script manually to observe any errors or unexpected behavior.
  2. Check the Microsoft Sentinel workspace for the presence of Custom Logs.

   **Note:** During the initial script execution, allow 5 to 10 minutes for the logs to appear in Microsoft Sentinel.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35997289/147014013-4444d9d8-888a-41f8-9f58-17242888a449.png)


## 5. Create the Log Analytics Parser funtions in Microsoft Sentinel.

The workbook relies on five Log Analytics Parser functions that must be created to process information from Custom Logs and calculate new fields based on raw data. Ensure that these functions are created with the following names:

- VASWUsersParser
- VASWComputersParser
- VASWGroupParser
- VASWAdminAuditParser
- VASWPawAuditParser

Note: In "**Legacy category**" field you can use "VASWFunctions" value for all functions.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35997289/147014420-2de4ee65-f3bb-4bb6-a8b3-b061956075ae.png)

## 6. Connect Domain Controllers to Microsoft Sentinel.
In most situations, your Domain Controllers will be located outside of Azure (on-premises). If this is the case, before enabling the [Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-manage?tabs=azure-portal), you will need to deploy [Azure ARC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/plan-at-scale-deployment) to connect your Domain Controllers to Azure, and then enable the AMA extension.

### 7. Import the "Visual Auditing Security Workbook with AMA"
1. Go to Microsoft Sentinel > Workbooks.
2. Click on **Add workbook**.
3. Click on edit and go to **Advanced Editor**.
4. Remove the default workbook code and paste the code of **Visual Auditing Security Workbook with AMA.workbook**
5. Click **apply**.
6. Configure the workbook **parameters and hide parameters**:
	- Azure Subscription: Hidden parameter, only visible in the workbook edition mode. The subscription where you have your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
	- Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
	- LAPSPasswordGUID (ms-mcs-AdmPwd): Hidden parameter. You need to enter the ms-mcs-AdmPwd GUID of your environment. It can be queried by running the following code:
    
    <pre><code>$rootdse = Get-ADRootDSE
    $GUIDs = Get-ADObject -SearchBase ($rootdse.SchemaNamingContext) -LDAPFilter "(schemaidguid=*)" -Properties lDAPDisplayName,schemaIDGUID
    ForEach ($Guid in $Guids)
    {
		    If ($guid.lDAPDisplayName -Like "*ms-mcs-admpwd")
      {
		      $SGuid = ([System.GUID]$guid.SchemaIDGuid).Guid
		      Write-host $guid.lDAPDisplayName, ([System.GUID]$guid.SchemaIDGuid)
		    }
    }
    </code></pre>
